# Iris Flower Classification
In this notebook, we will train a variety of machine learning models to classify images from the [Iris Flower Dataset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. In this experiment, we will try out the following models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. Deep Neural Network
